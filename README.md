RESEARCH PLAN:Assessing CodeLlama for Student Code Evaluation
To assess CodeLlama for student Python code evaluation, I will initially select a dataset of 5–10 code snippets spanning various levels of student ability, including deliberate errors such as syntax errors, logical errors, and inefficiencies. I will then analyze these snippets using CodeLlama, noting its capacity to identify errors and produce pedagogical prompts. To ensure its performance, I will compare its responses with human-annotated feedback from teachers and static analyzers such as Pylint. Teachers will score the prompts on clarity, relevance, and pedagogical value using a 1–5 scale, while I will quantify the latency and resource usage of the model to check its feasibility for real-time educational applications.

I chose CodeLlama because it is open-source, tuned for code analysis, and can be customized to fit educational needs, where data privacy and flexibility are considerations. Although it won't be as accurate as proprietary solutions like GitHub Copilot, its capacity to create meaningful prompts and give detailed feedback makes it a worthwhile tool for educators. Yet, constraints like possible difficulties with profound conceptual flaws and GPU reliance need to be weighed. My reasoning method has accessibility, pedagogical value, and efficiency as top considerations, trying to assess whether CodeLlama can help teachers deliver automated, thoughtful feedback to students to some extent.

     ### **Reasoning: Key Considerations for Evaluating CodeLlama**
What makes a model appropriate for high-level competence evaluation? A model that is appropriate for high-level competence assessment needs to look beyond syntax testing to detect logical mistakes, inefficiencies, and conceptual confusion in students' code. It needs to offer actionable, understandable feedback on why a mistake has been made and how to correct it, and not merely indicate errors. For instance, if a student uses recursion incorrectly, the model ought to detect the confusion and offer recommendations for improvement. Furthermore, the model should be adjustable for varying levels of skill and programming principles to remain applicable to varied student submissions.

How would you test if a model produces good prompts? To evaluate prompt quality, I would employ a mix of human assessment and comparison analysis. Teachers would score prompts on a 1–5 basis for clarity, relevance, and pedagogical usefulness, whereas students could offer feedback on their usefulness. I'd also compare prompts by the model to feedback written by humans as well as static analysis tools to analyze depth and originality. For instance, a prompt like "Why did you do a bubble sort here? Can you find a better way?" would rank higher than a prompt like "Fix your loop." I'd also examine whether the prompts are specific to address underlying issues in the code, such as logical errors or inefficientness.

What potential trade-offs are there between cost, interpretability, and accuracy? In model selection, a number of trade-offs have to be made:

Cost vs. Accuracy: Bigger models (e.g., CodeLlama-70B) provide better accuracy at the cost of more computational power, which increases costs as well as latency. Smaller ones (e.g., CodeLlama-7B) are quicker and less expensive but compromise on depth.
Interpretability vs. Depth: Human-like explanation is offered by large language models (LLMs) but they are "black boxes," so less transparent in their decision-making process. Rule-based tools like Pylint are interpretable but confine to syntax and style checks.
Speed vs. Quality: Quicker models might overlook subtle errors, whereas slower and more accurate models might introduce delays in sending feedback.
It balances these trade-offs based on the situation: For instance, a classroom environment could stress speed and cost, whereas high-stakes testing would value accuracy and interpretability.

Why did I select CodeLlama, and what are its advantages or drawbacks? I selected CodeLlama because it balances accuracy, customizability, and ease of use. Since it is an open-source model that has been fine-tuned for code, it can be locally deployed, with data privacy as a key consideration in educational environments. Its capacity to produce pedagogical prompts and study code in detail makes it superior to static tools such as Pylint, which are not explanatory.

Advantages:

Code-Specific Fine-Tuning: Strong at identifying syntax, logical faults, and inefficiencies.
Prompt Generation: Is able to generate Socratic questions and responses that are specific to the learning levels of students.
Customizable: Further fine-tunable for particular learning requirements.
Local Deployment: Does not require external API dependency, maintaining privacy.
Limitations:

Conceptual Errors: May fail when faced with profound misunderstandings (e.g., flawed mental models of algorithms).
Resource-Intensive: Needs GPU support for real-time analysis, which is not possible in all schools.
Prompt Sensitivity: Output quality is heavily reliant upon the specificity of input prompts.
Hallucinations: Sometimes produces incorrect or irrelevant responses, particularly for imprecise code.
In short, CodeLlama is a useful option for pedagogical code analysis, providing a good combination of accuracy, pedagogical quality, and usability, although potentially requiring supplementation (e.g., human examination) for higher-level conceptual feedback.
