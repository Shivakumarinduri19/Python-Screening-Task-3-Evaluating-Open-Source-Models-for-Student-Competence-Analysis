Search Plan: Assessing CodeLlama for Student Code Evaluation
To assess CodeLlama for student Python code evaluation, I will initially select a dataset of 5–10 code snippets spanning various levels of student ability, including deliberate errors such as syntax errors, logical errors, and inefficiencies. I will then analyze these snippets using CodeLlama, noting its capacity to identify errors and produce pedagogical prompts. To ensure its performance, I will compare its responses with human-annotated feedback from teachers and static analyzers such as Pylint. Teachers will score the prompts on clarity, relevance, and pedagogical value using a 1–5 scale, while I will quantify the latency and resource usage of the model to check its feasibility for real-time educational applications.

I chose CodeLlama because it is open-source, tuned for code analysis, and can be customized to fit educational needs, where data privacy and flexibility are considerations. Although it won't be as accurate as proprietary solutions like GitHub Copilot, its capacity to create meaningful prompts and give detailed feedback makes it a worthwhile tool for educators. Yet, constraints like possible difficulties with profound conceptual flaws and GPU reliance need to be weighed. My reasoning method has accessibility, pedagogical value, and efficiency as top considerations, trying to assess whether CodeLlama can help teachers deliver automated, thoughtful feedback to students to some extent.

     ### **Reasoning: Key Considerations for Evaluating CodeLlama**
What makes a model appropriate for high-level competence evaluation? A model that is appropriate for high-level competence assessment needs to look beyond syntax testing to detect logical mistakes, inefficiencies, and conceptual confusion in students' code. It needs to offer actionable, understandable feedback on why a mistake has been made and how to correct it, and not merely indicate errors. For instance, if a student uses recursion incorrectly, the model ought to detect the confusion and offer recommendations for improvement. Furthermore, the model should be adjustable for varying levels of skill and programming principles to remain applicable to varied student submissions.

How would you test if a model produces good prompts? To evaluate prompt quality, I would employ a mix of human assessment and comparison analysis. Teachers would score prompts on a 1–5 basis for clarity, relevance, and pedagogical usefulness, whereas students could offer feedback on their usefulness. I'd also compare prompts by the model to feedback written by humans as well as static analysis tools to analyze depth and originality. For instance, a prompt like "Why did you do a bubble sort here? Can you find a better way?" would rank higher than a prompt like "Fix your loop." I'd also examine whether the prompts are specific to address underlying issues in the code, such as logical errors or inefficientness.

What potential trade-offs are there between cost, interpretability, and accuracy? In model selection, a number of trade-offs have to be made:

Cost vs. Accuracy: Bigger models (e.g., CodeLlama-70B) provide better accuracy at the cost of more computational power, which increases costs as well as latency. Smaller ones (e.g., CodeLlama-7B) are quicker and less expensive but compromise on depth.
Interpretability vs. Depth: Human-like explanation is offered by large language models (LLMs) but they are "black boxes," so less transparent in their decision-making process. Rule-based tools like Pylint are interpretable but confine to syntax and style checks.
Speed vs. Quality: Quicker models might overlook subtle errors, whereas slower and more accurate models might introduce delays in sending feedback.
It balances these trade-offs based on the situation: For instance, a classroom environment could stress speed and cost, whereas high-stakes testing would value accuracy and interpretability.

Why did I select CodeLlama, and what are its advantages or drawbacks? I selected CodeLlama because it balances accuracy, customizability, and ease of use. Since it is an open-source model that has been fine-tuned for code, it can be locally deployed, with data privacy as a key consideration in educational environments. Its capacity to produce pedagogical prompts and study code in detail makes it superior to static tools such as Pylint, which are not explanatory.

Advantages:

Code-Specific Fine-Tuning: Strong at identifying syntax, logical faults, and inefficiencies.
Prompt Generation: Is able to generate Socratic questions and responses that are specific to the learning levels of students.
Customizable: Further fine-tunable for particular learning requirements.
Local Deployment: Does not require external API dependency, maintaining privacy.
Limitations:

Conceptual Errors: May fail when faced with profound misunderstandings (e.g., flawed mental models of algorithms).
Resource-Intensive: Needs GPU support for real-time analysis, which is not possible in all schools.
Prompt Sensitivity: Output quality is heavily reliant upon the specificity of input prompts.
Hallucinations: Sometimes produces incorrect or irrelevant responses, particularly for imprecise code.
In short, CodeLlama is a useful option for pedagogical code analysis, providing a good combination of accuracy, pedagogical quality, and usability, although potentially requiring supplementation (e.g., human examination) for higher-level conceptual feedback.

INSTALLATION
### **How to Install and Set Up CodeLlama for Python Code Analysis**
To run CodeLlama to analyze student Python code, take these steps to install and set up the model in your environment. This tutorial presumes you have a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Colab, or a local Python installation) and a GPU (optional for faster inference).

Step 1: Install Required Dependencies
Execute the following commands to install the required libraries:

# Install PyTorch with CUDA support (for GPU acceleration)
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# Install transformers, bitsandbytes (for 4-bit quantization), and accelerate
pip install transformers bitsandbytes accelerate
Note: If you're using Google Colab, you can run these commands in a cell by prefixing them with ! (e.g., !pip install transformers).

Step 2: Load the CodeLlama Model
Load the CodeLlama-7B model with 4-bit quantization using the following Python code for efficient inference:

from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, BitsAndBytesConfig
import torch

# Set 4-bit quantization for memory saving
quantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.float16,
    bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4",
)

# Download the CodeLlama model and tokenizer
model_name = "codellama/CodeLlama-7b-hf"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    device_map="auto",  # Automatically allocates GPU if available
    quantization_config=quantization_config,
)
Key Points:

4-bit quantization reduces the model’s memory footprint, allowing it to run on consumer-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 3060 or better).
device_map="auto" ensures the model uses your GPU if available.
Step 3: Define Functions for Code Analysis and Prompt Generation
Create functions to analyze student code and generate pedagogical prompts:

def analyze_code(code):
    """Analyze student code for errors, inefficiencies, or misconceptions."""
    prompt = f"""
You are a Python teaching assistant.
    Analyze the following code for errors, inefficiencies, or misconceptions.
    Explain the issues and suggest a question to assess the student's understanding.
    Code:
    ```python
    {code}
    ```
    """
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=200, temperature=0.3)
return tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

def generate_prompts(code):
    """Generate Socratic questions to test the student's understanding."""
    prompt = f"""
    Generate 3 Socratic questions to test a student's understanding of this code:
    ```python
    {code}
    ```
Focus on conceptual gaps, not syntax errors.
    """
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
    outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=150, temperature=0.5)
    return tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
Key Points:

analyze_code focuses on identifying errors and inefficiencies.
generate_prompts creates Socratic questions to assess student understanding.
Adjust max_new_tokens and temperature to control response length and creativity.
Step 4: Test the Model with Example Code
Use the following example to test the model:

# Example student code with explicit mistakes
student_code = """"def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

a = 5
print(factorial(a))
print(a / b)  # Error: 'b' is not defined"""
""""


# Execute analysis
analysis = analyze_code(student_code)
print("=== CODE ANALYSIS ===",
      analysis)

# Generate prompts
prompts = generate_prompts(student_code)
print("\
=== SUGGESTED PROMPTS ===\
", prompts)
Expected Output:

The model should mark the undefined variable b and indicate the error.
It should provide Socratic questions such as:
"Why did you put the division operation there? What if b is not defined?"
"How would you change this code to deal with negative n's?"
Step 5: Save and Export Results
To preserve the analysis and prompts for future inspection:

with open("codellama_output.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("=== CODE ANALYSIS ===
" + analysis + "

")
    f.write("=== SUGGESTED PROMPTS ===
" + prompts + "")
